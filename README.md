# Library-Management-System-DSA-
A C-based Library Management System built for a Data Structures course. This command-line project uses a Binary Search Tree to store the book collection, a Stack to manage a LIFO return cart, and a Queue to handle FIFO waiting lists for popular books. It simulates core library functions like checkouts and returns.
